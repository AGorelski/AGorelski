- 👋 Hi, I’m @AGorelski
I'm a passionate programmer with a broad set of skills including Java, Python, JavaScript, web development frameworks and technologies, machine learning, data management and data analytics. I bring a wealth of experience to any software engineering or programming role, with a proven track record of success working for one of the biggest companies in semiconductors manufacturing and on several projects related to business topics and data mining.
- 👀 My goal is to upload the projects that I work on and develop my skills by accessing other open repositories and working with new and exciting frameworks and tools. I'm interested in exploring cutting-edge technologies and contributing to open-source projects that make a positive impact on society.
- 🌱 I'm excited to deepen my knowledge in this area and apply it to new projects.
- 💞️ I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others on interesting projects. If you have a project you'd like to work on together, don't hesitate to reach out!
